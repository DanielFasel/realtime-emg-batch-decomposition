# What is EMG Batch Decomposition?
Blind source seperation, etc. Why is it interesting. What can we expect, how many sources
# Why Realtime?
Why is realtime important. what does realtime mean, delay, etc. What needs to be done for it to work.
# Code Architecture
This Chapter will explain the different files and what they do. It will also give an overview of the integration with the outside frameworks.
# Calibration Algorithm
This chapter will descripe the calibration algrithm in a step by step matter. It will also explain the input and the output of the algorithm. As well as comparitions with the matlab algoritm. What changed what didn't what are some of the differences.
# Realtime Decomposition Algorithm
This chapter will explain the premise of the real-time algorithm. As well as the data flow for realtime operation.
# Result and Limitiations
Comparing the calibration with the matlab results. Check the realtime results with the simulated data. Check the fully realtime setup with optional control algorithm as a demonstrations. 
Show limitations, sucha as drifting, movements, etc.
